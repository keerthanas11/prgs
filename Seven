1. Create Two Sample Files
nano file1.txt
(Add some text → save with CTRL+O, exit with CTRL+X)
nano file2.txt
(Add slightly different text → save and exit)

2. Compare Files Using diff
diff file1.txt file2.txt

3. Use cmp for Byte-Level Comparison
cmp -l file1.txt file2.txt

4. Use vimdiff for Side-by-Side Colored View
vimdiff file1.txt file2.txt

Navigation:
]c → Jump to next change
[c → Jump to previous change
:qa! → Quit both files

5. Use meld (GUI Tool – Similar to Compare It)
If you want a GUI comparison like Compare It:
sudo apt update
sudo apt install meld -y
Then run:
meld file1.txt file2.txt

6. Generate a Forensic Report
diff -u file1.txt file2.txt > diff_report.txt
